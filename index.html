              <p>War brings widespread destruction to infrastructure, homes, and entire communities. Cities and towns are ravaged, leaving behind a trail of devastation that takes years, if not decades, to rebuild. The displacement of people from their homes due to war forces them to seek refuge elsewhere, causing immense upheaval and often leading to the creation of refugee populations. Displacement disrupts lives, separates families, and adds to the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict.</p>
